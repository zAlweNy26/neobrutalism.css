# NeoBrutalism.css

NeoBrutalism library in CSS!

Just copy the CSS file `neobrutalism.css` into your project and link it in your HTML file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="neobrutalism.css">
```

And you're good to go!

## Some things to note

- I use TailwindCSS for the CSS reset and utility classes, so you might see some classes that you don't recognize.
- I took inspiration from [giuppi.dev](https://www.giuppi.dev/) for the idea.
- Any feedback is appreciated! Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
